The project is implemented with Machine Learning for the detection of the quality of a beverage.
The Concept of the project revolves around a particular work flow.
## Work Flow
- Beverage data
- Data Analysis
- Data Pre Processing
- Train Test split
- Random forest model
- New Data-------->Trained Random Forest Model---------> Quality of Wine
  ## Kaggle
  Kaggle's Dataset has been used build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not.
## The quality of a wine is determined by following:
    Fixed acidity
    Volatile acidity
    Citric acid
    Residual sugar
    Chlorides
    Free sulfur dioxide
    Total sulfur dioxide
    Density
    pH
    Sulfates
    Alcohol
